This repository implements a comprehensive validation framework combining inter-rater reliability analysis, random-effects meta-analysis, meta-regression, sensitivity diagnostics, and machine learning to evaluate ordinal validation scores across studies. Methods include unweighted and weighted Cohen’s Kappa, logistic meta-analysis with REML estimation, influence diagnostics, and random forest models for predicting perfect validation scores, all implemented in R.
